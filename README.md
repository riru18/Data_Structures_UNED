# Data_Structures_UNED
Repo containing all-things related to my Data Structures course from UNED Costa Rica.

Tutoria1 contains code written by the professor. 

Proyecto1 contains the folder where I'm working on my 1st DS project. 

This course starts with Java but it will probably focus on Python and/or C++ later on.
